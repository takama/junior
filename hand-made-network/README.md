# Hand made Network

This project was developed in connection with the need for data transfer between the PC. In those deaf times, there were no any wide-used networks between nearby computers. It was hard to transfer information between PC on floppy disks due to the unreliability of the floppy disks themselves, the compatibility of disk drives and the possibility of getting the virus in the MBR. A network was planned for the technology of the transfer of a marker using a coaxial cable and homemade network cards.
