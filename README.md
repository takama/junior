My early experience (1993-1994) in assembler and "C" programming

When I was 24 I've had some programming experience related to `assembler x86`, `C`, and `hand-made-networking`.
Nowadays I don't use this things and don't remember most of all of this stuff. But I remember, It was very interesting and fun.
