My early experience (1993-1994) in assembler and "C" programming

When I was 24 I've had some programming experience related to `assembler x86`, `C`, and `hand-made-networking`.
Nowadays I don't use this things and don't remember most of all of this stuff. But I remember, It was very interesting and fun.

## Hand made Network

This project was developed in connection with issue. In those deaf times, there were no any wide-used networks between nearby computers. It was not convenient to transfer information between PC on floppy disks due to the unreliability of the floppy disks themselves, the compatibility of disk drives and the possibility of getting the virus in the MBR. A network was planned for the technology of the transfer of a marker using a coaxial cable and homemade network cards.

## The Cyrillic Keyboard/Fonts driver

## Experiments with MBR and protection against the spread of MBR viruses

## The utilities which developed on demand
